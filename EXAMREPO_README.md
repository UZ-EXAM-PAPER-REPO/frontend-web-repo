# ExamRepo Frontend (Vite + React)

This project implements a landing page UI inspired by a Figma mock (ExamRepo). It contains a responsive hero, stats, browse-by-faculty cards, navigation, and placeholder pages (Browse, Upload, Login, Admin).

## Setup & Run

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the URL shown by Vite) to view the UI.

## Notes

- The login form is a mock (no backend integration).
- Replace `src/assets/hero.svg` and `src/assets/logo.svg` with your design assets.
- The project is structured to be easily extended for real APIs (Browse and Upload pages are placeholders).
